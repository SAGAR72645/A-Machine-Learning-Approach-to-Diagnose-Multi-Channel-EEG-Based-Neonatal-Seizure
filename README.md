A Machine Learning Approach to Diagnose Multi Channel EEG Based Neonatal Seizure

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach to diagnose neonatal seizures using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The goal is to create an automated system that can accurately detect and classify seizures in neonatal patients, which is crucial for early intervention and treatment.

Main Function Points
Preprocessing and feature extraction from multi-channel EEG data
Applying principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space
Implementing various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, to classify seizure and non-seizure events
Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Exploring techniques like oversampling to address the class imbalance problem in the dataset
